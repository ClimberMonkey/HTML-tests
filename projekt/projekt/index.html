                                    <h4>Top Advice on how to Brew your Tea</h4>
                                    <p>Use a kettle that is free of limescale or sediment.
                                    Fill your kettle with fresh water. Water that has been previously boiled loses oxygen
                                    and can weaken the flavor of your tea. Warm the teapot and/or your mug with the hot water.
                                    Pour some of the freshly heated water in your teapot or mug and swish it around, then 
                                    dump it out. This will warm your mug or teapot, keeping your tea hot for a longer period 
                                    of time</p>
